## TODO
-  Create workspace-driven customization in order to build repeatable environments
    - Need to understand the if/then logic required to do this (.e.g if dev, use this subnet CIDR)
- Remove bootstap backend items (dynambodb table and s3 bucket) - these need to be handled by the bootstrapping script I'm working on
